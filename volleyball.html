    <h1>Volleyball</h1>
	
	<p>I started playing volleyball in my freshman year of high school. It is kinda weird how I got into it because I watched this show called "Haikyu!". Somewhat embarassing that an animated show is what got me into the sport I play most days of my life. Unfortunately my freshman year season was cut short due to COVID, but I was determined to come back the next year better than ever. So I trained as much as I could during the pandemic and when the next season rolled around, I made the JV team and was named one of the team captains! Now, I am doing my club season with this team called Indigo volleyball club in preparation for the school season in March. I play the libero position which is the only player on the floor that wears a different colored jersey. My position specializes in defense and passing so I am not the one usually spiking the ball.</p>
